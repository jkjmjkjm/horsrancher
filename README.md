# HorsRancher
A website (now), app (later hopefully) and fully functioning platform (sometime in the future possibly) to view availability of, reserve and pay for horse-riding lessons in Spain. Created out of the frustration with current solutions (i.e. none) and as a final project for Harvard's CS50 and expand(ing) and finish(ing) for Hack Club.
